This is code I have used from Michael Halls-Moore's Quantstart.com site.  I have
to make a couple of changes to the code to make it work - specifically, I have
to add an account name, and to run trades more than once I had to change the
order ID (noted in code).  Will probably use this set up in future for trading
on IB using Python.  Very handy stuff! :)
